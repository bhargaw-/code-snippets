Liferay is a rich portal application which provides different ways to customize it.
 In liferay there are so many tools/api s are integrated and we can plug more and also customize existing one as per our requirement.
 Liferay also provide lots off JSON webservises to integrate it with different technology.
 As we can create mobile apps/many other different type of integration using its webservices

In Liferay we have basically two ways to display data:

       Using portlet, by this we can display data and using this way we have many configurations and customization
       Using web content and template which is rendered dynamically at run times

In web content we have option for structure template which use VM and alloy UI using that we just render data in a desired view.
 Liferay also provides different JS object available on front end and even we can use liferay service util with the help of JS.
 As it works in control panel>server Administration > Script

// ### Javascript Sample ###
 number = Packages.com.liferay.portal.service.UserLocalServiceUtil.getUsersCount();
 out.println(number);  

 

As angular JS provides many mechanism to services call and frontend task to do in easy way.
 So, using angular JS with liferay we can achieve much functionality with basic Webcontent and angular JS only.

 

Lets see some examples:
 1. We want to display the current logged in Userâ€™s full name on the page using WCM :

 

<script src= "http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.5.8/angular.min.js"></script>
 <div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="userInfo"><button ng-click="getUserInfo()">Get user info</button>
 <p>User's Name: <input ng-model="userName" type="text" /></p>
 </div>
 <script>
 var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
 app.controller('userInfo', ['$scope', '$window', function($scope, $window){
     $scope.userName = "",
     $scope.getUserInfo = function() {
         $scope.userName = $window.Liferay.ThemeDisplay.getUserName();
     };
 }] );
 </script>   

 

So, this is very simple way to get angular js use, we can use this code in theme or as basic web content.
 Now lets we use angularjs with liferay json ws to get the current user emailId

 

<script src= "http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.5.8/angular.min.js"></script>
 <div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="personCtrl">
 <button class="btn" ng-click="userData()">Get user email</button>
 <p>User Email: <input ng-model="email" type="text" /></p>
 </div>
 <script>
 var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
 app.controller('personCtrl', ['$scope', '$window', function($scope, $window) {
     $scope.userData = function() {
         $window.Liferay.Service(
           '/user/get-user-by-id',
           {
             userId: $window.Liferay.ThemeDisplay.getUserId()
           },
           function(obj) {
             $scope.email = obj.emailAddress;
           }
         );
     };
 }]);
 </script>
